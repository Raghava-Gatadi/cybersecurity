## Overview

This Django project provides a web-based network scanning tool that identifies systems connected to the user's network. Utilizing the Django framework, the application displays the IP addresses and MAC addresses of the connected systems and identifies any open ports on those systems. The project leverages the power of Django's web framework for a user-friendly and interactive experience.

3. Run the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the network scanner application.

5. Use the web interface to scan the network and view the list of connected systems, their IP addresses, MAC addresses, and open ports.

## Example
